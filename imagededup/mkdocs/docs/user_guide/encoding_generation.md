# Encoding generation
It might be desirable to only generate the hashes/cnn encodings for a given image or all images in a directory instead
of directly deduplicating using find_duplicates method. Encodings can be generated for a directory of images or for a 
single image:

- [Encoding generation for all images in a directory](#encoding-generation-for-all-images-in-a-directory)
- [Encoding generation for a single image](#encoding-generation-for-a-single-image)


## Encoding generation for all images in a directory
To generate encodings for all images in an image directory *encode_images* function can be used. The general api for 
using *encode_images* is:
```python
from imagededup.methods import <method-name>
method_object = <method-name>()
encodings = method_object.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')
```
where the returned variable *encodings* is a dictionary mapping image file names to corresponding encoding:
```
{
  'image1.jpg': <encoding-image-1>,
  'image2.jpg': <encoding-image-2>,
   ..
}
```
For hashing algorithms, the encodings are 64 bit hashes represented as 16 character hexadecimal strings.

For cnn, the encodings are numpy array with shape (1, 1024).

The 'method-name' corresponds to one of the deduplication methods available and can be set to:

- PHash
- AHash
- DHash
- WHash
- CNN


#### Options
- image_dir: Path to the image directory for which encodings are to be generated.

#### Considerations

If an image in the image directory can't be loaded, no encodings are generated for the image. Hence, there is no entry 
for the image in the returned encodings dictionary.

#### Examples

Generating encodings using Difference hash:
```python
from imagededup.methods import DHash
dhasher = DHash()
encodings = dhasher.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')
```

## Encoding generation for a single image
To generate encodings for a single image *encode_image* function can be used. The general api for 
using *encode_image* is:
```python
from imagededup.methods import <method-name>
method_object = <method-name>()
encoding = method_object.encode_image(image_file='path/to/image/file')
```
where the returned variable *encoding* is either a hexadecimal string if a hashing method is used or a (1, 1024) numpy 
array if cnn is used.

#### Options
- image_file: Optional, path to the image file for which encodings are to be generated.
- image_array: Optional, used instead of *image_file* attribute. A numpy array representing the image.

#### Considerations

If the image can't be loaded, no encodings are generated for the image and *None* is returned.

#### Examples

Generating encodings using Difference hash:
```python
from imagededup.methods import DHash
dhasher = DHash()
encoding = dhasher.encode_image(image_file='path/to/image/file')
```
