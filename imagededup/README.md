imagededup is a python package that simplifies the task of finding **exact** and **near duplicates** in an image collection.

<p align="center">

</p>

This package provides functionality to make use of hashing algorithms that are particularly good at finding exact 
duplicates as well as convolutional neural networks which are also adept at finding near duplicates. An evaluation 
framework is also provided to judge the quality of deduplication for a given dataset.

Following details the functionality provided by the package:

- Finding duplicates in a directory using one of the following algorithms:
    - [Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861) (CNN)
    - [Perceptual hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) (PHash)
    - [Difference hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html) (DHash)
    - [Wavelet hashing](https://fullstackml.com/wavelet-image-hash-in-python-3504fdd282b5) (WHash)
    - [Average hashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) (AHash)
- Generation of encodings for images using one of the above stated algorithms.
- Framework to evaluate effectiveness of deduplication  given a ground truth mapping.
- Plotting duplicates found for a given image file.

Detailed documentation for the package can be found at: [https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/](https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/)

imagededup is compatible with Python 3.6 and is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Installation
There are two ways to install imagededup:

* Install imagededup from PyPI (recommended):

```
pip install imagededup
```

⚠️ **Note**: imagededup comes with TensorFlow CPU-only support by default. If you have GPUs, you should rather 
install the TensorFlow version with GPU support especially when you use CNN to find duplicates. It's way faster. See the 
[TensorFlow guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu) for more details on how to install it. 

* Install imagededup from the GitHub source:

```
git clone https://github.com/idealo/imagededup.git
cd imagededup  
python setup.py install
```  

## Quick start

In order to find duplicates in an image directory using perceptual hashing, following workflow can be used:

- Import perceptual hashing method

```python
from imagededup.methods import PHash
phasher = PHash()
```

- Generate encodings for all images in an image directory

```python
encodings = phasher.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')
```

- Find duplicates using the generated encodings
```python
duplicates = phasher.find_duplicates(encoding_map=encodings)
```

- Plot duplicates obtained for a given file (eg: 'ukbench00120.jpg') using the duplicates dictionary
```python
from imagededup.utils import plot_duplicates
plot_duplicates(image_dir='path/to/image/directory', 
                duplicate_map=duplicates, 
                filename='ukbench00120.jpg')
```
The output looks as below:

The complete code for the workflow is:
```python
from imagededup.methods import PHash
phasher = PHash()

# Generate encodings for all images in an image directory
encodings = phasher.encode_images(image_dir='path/to/image/directory')

# Find duplicates using the generated encodings
duplicates = phasher.find_duplicates(encoding_map=encodings)

# plot duplicates obtained for a given file using the duplicates dictionary
from imagededup.utils import plot_duplicates
plot_duplicates(image_dir='path/to/image/directory', 
                duplicate_map=duplicates, 
                filename='ukbench00120.jpg')
```
